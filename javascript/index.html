Take the following steps:
1. Using JavaScript, select all the page elements and set them as
JavaScript objects so they are easier to select within the code. Also
select all the page elements that have the error class as an object.
2. Add an event listener to submit and capture the click, preventing the
default form action.
3. Loop through all the page elements that have a class error and add
the hide class, which will remove them from view since this is a new
submission.
4. Using the regular expression for valid emails, test the results against
the input value of the email field.
5. Create a function to respond to errors, which removes the hide class
from the element next to the element that triggered the event. Apply
focus to that element within the function.
6. If there is an error that an input does not match the desired regex, pass
the parameters to the error handling function you just created.
7. Check the password field input value to ensure only letters and
numbers are used. Also check the length to ensure that it is 3-8
characters. If either are false, then add the error with the error function
and create a message for the user. Set the error Boolean to true .
8. Add in an object to track the form data creation and add values to the
object by looping through all the inputs, setting the property name to
 <input type="text" name="email"> <span class="error hide
 <br> Password :
 <input type="password" name="password"> <span class="err
 <br> User Name :
 <input type="text" name="userName"> <span class="error h
 <br>
 <input type="submit" value="Sign Up"> </form>
